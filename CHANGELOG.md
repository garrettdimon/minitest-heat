## [Unreleased]

Nothing at the moment.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-12-09

The biggest update is that the slow thresholds are now configurable.

- Configurable Thresholds
- Fixed a bug where `vendor/bundle` gem files were considered project source code files
- Set up [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/garrettdimon/minitest-heat/actions) to ensure tests are run on Ubuntu latest and macOs for the [latest Ruby versions](https://github.com/garrettdimon/minitest-heat/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml)
- Fixed some tests that were accidentally left path-dependent and couldn't pass on other machines

## [1.0.0] - 2021-12-01

Initial release.
