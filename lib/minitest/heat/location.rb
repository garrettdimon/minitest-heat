    # Convenience methods for determining the file and line number where the problem occurred.
    #   There are several layers of specificity to help make it easy to communicate the relative
    #   location of the failure:
    #   - 'final' represents the final line of the backtrace regardless of where it is
    #   - 'test' represents the last line from the project's tests. It is further differentiated by
    #     the line where the test is defined and the actual line of code in the test that geneated
    #     the failure or exception
    #   - 'source_code' represents the last line from the project's source code
    #   - 'project' represents the last source line, but falls back to the last test line
    #   - 'most_relevant' represents the most specific file to investigate starting with the source
    #     code and then looking to the test code with final line of the backtrace as a fallback
