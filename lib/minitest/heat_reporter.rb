module Minitest
  # Custom minitest reporter to proactively identify likely culprits in test failures by focusing on
  #   the files and line numbers with the most issues and that were most recently modified. It also
  #   visually emphasizes results based on the most significant problems.
  #   1. Errors - Anything that raised an exception could have significant ripple effects.
  #   2. Failures - Assuming no exceptions, these are kind of important.
  #   -- Everything else...
  #   3. Coverage (If using Simplecov) - If things are passing but coverage isn't up to par
  #   4. Skips - Don't want to skip tests.
  #   5. Slows (If everything good, but there's )
  # - Colorize the Output
  # - What files had the most errors?
  # - Show the most impacted areas first.
  # - Show lowest-level (most nested code) frist.
